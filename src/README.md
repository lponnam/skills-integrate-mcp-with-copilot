   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Switching to a persistent database (development)

This project can use a SQLite database for local development. Steps:

1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable (optional). By default the app uses `sqlite:///./dev.db`.

3. Start the app (it will create tables and seed sample activities on first run):

```bash
python src/app.py
```

4. (Optional) Use Alembic to create/manage migrations. The repo includes a minimal Alembic scaffold.
